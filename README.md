This project focuses on analyzing bike ride data in London. The dataset underwent thorough data wrangling to ensure it was primed for visualization. Using Tableau, I created a dynamic report with a line chart displaying moving averages across selected days. Additionally, a heat map illustrates ride counts in relation to temperature and wind speed. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) showcases the total number of rides within the chosen range. The report allows for flexible customization of moving average parameters. Users can hover over charts for detailed insights on ride distribution based on weather conditions and time of day.
